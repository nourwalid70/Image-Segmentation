Problem Statement
An image segmentation model that groups similar pixels together and gives these grouped pixels the same label. The grouping problem is a clustering problem. We use the K-means algorithm on the Berkeley Segmentation Benchmark. The data is available at the following link. http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/BSR/BSR_bsds500.tgz. The dataset has 500 images. The test set is 200 images only
